            Makhosi Mkhulu Ngonyama Nyathi was born on the 30/09/2018. uMakhosi ungu mama ohamba nomoya wamakhosi. In 2018 uBaba wangibiza, ngasabela, ngavuma, ngamukela, nganele! ngiyingonyama, ngiliqhawe, I am a blessing, I am chosen, I worship the creator and I acknowledge my ancestors. I am different, I am a woman who is not meant to be understood by the flash but through spiritual intervention, umoya, and seeking Him I will be understood by the meant. Makhosi Mkhulu Ngonyama Nyathi represents the Creator who is faith. Makhosi is a newly born spiritual comrade woman, a praying warrior, a woman born for ingane ensundu, I am real and beautiful, a very humble respectful woman, I am love, born to love and to give love to ingane ensundu. I am a woman that has been taught who is a woman as per creation nangokwendabuko. As per creation, angidalelwanga ilungelo ngoba ubaba wouldn’t have put me through so much pain, 5 years of solid pain ngaphansi kwesimo somuntu wesifazane. I am a woman who will immediately and unapologetically put you in your place should I sense and feel any form of disrespect in any form.<br><br>
            I am taught to always stand up for myself, I am moved by anything that means family, and I am taught to understand and to live by the true meaning of “hlonipha uyihlo nonyoko ukuze izinsuku zakho zande ezweni”. Ngiwu mama oyisambatho ngaphakathi, I am not allowed to be too angry, I am energy hence the reason I am mostly kept in isolation from the outside world. I am a woman who has been tortured for a ingane ensundu, a bravely unstoppable strong woman, through my pain victory, I am faith, I am undoubtedly still standing, ngimile!. As per his home, we are faith-driven, one of our functions is to reach out to ingane ensundu and give unconditional love. Once Makhosi has touched you let your faith finalize your blessing, I am differently spiritually called to heal only the chosen and to make a difference as guided by the creator in any form in the black community.<br><br>
            Gugu, Cebisile, Makhosi Mkhulu Ngonyama Nyathi is the same person gifted to heal in 3 different forms. Gugu means precious, Cebisile means advice & wealth and Nyathi means a Buffalo. I am the creator’s chosen daughter. Gugu was born on the 31/03/1983; I was raised and grew up between  Meadowlands Zone 9 (home) and Diepkloof Phase 3 (maternal home) in Soweto. Ngiyingane ehamba nabadala “ancestors”. Ngiyingane yombango from the Qwabe clan (maternal), the Sangweni clan and the Nyathi clan (paternal), ngihamba nabo bonke. My spiritual name is Makhosi Mkhulu Ngonyama Nyathi. Gugu's born gift is to study human behavior, analyse where the problem originates, and heal by advising on how to solve the problem based on the origin. I am a healing energy, I am a born called Psychologist. Makhosi heals in different forms through prayer, by praying for water and through a healing stick. All names functions work hand in hand to heal, depending on the type of healing required at hand each name function comes through. I am a loving mother to a humble respectful chosen son named Keyaleboha which means gratitude.<br><br> 
            I am the founder of the Makhosi Mkhulu Ngonyama Nyathi Foundation and the Keyaleboha Foundation. Both homes are working hand in hand, side by side serving uBaba. At first, it was hard to believe that I am capable of running my own company, but as I spiritually grew and became more content about who I am, all became possible. I am grounded and humbled by the confidence ubaba has instilled in my life by loving me unconditionally, supporting and believing in me when everyone around me is convinced I have lost my mind. My journey’s teachings are based on Transition, Strength, and Faith. During the 5 years, I met different types of people who were part of my journey for spiritual teaching purposes. During this period, I went through a lot of judgment simply because I am differently called meaning my initiation is also different. 
            
            Ngane ensundu this is how Makhosi Mkhulu Ngonyama Nyathi Foundation is born, through my pain victory, through my faith, rejection, insults & judgment from family and friends, through my strength, through my poverty & thirst, through my jailhouse, through my imperfections, through oppression from a white child, through my sons love, support & understanding, through my twin flame’s painful imperfections, through my soul mate’s support, through the chosen elder’s love & support from uzayoni kamoya, and my conversation with the creator. Through it all, all I need from the chosen is your faith. My reach-out message will always be different from any other message, which means you might not know how to respond based on disbelief, when this happens always take your time, and seek his intervention to assist you on whether this is real or not. I strongly confirm that our only ticket to his kingdom is our faith and our heart. The creator will always reveal himself in any form, no one can ever confirm him, this person does not have to live in a huge house, this person does not need to have a car, and this person will come to your home and reveal their identity while dressed anyhow.
             Due to being an energy person, I will always be drawn by your heart and your faith.<br><br>
